This OS will be my first attempt at developing everything from scratch.

    2- a more modern reboot function. this keyboard way not much good. 
    3- fixing backspace feature.
    4- Tab completion.
    5- Command history (up/down arrows).
    6- adding more commands such as meminfo, also modular commands system.
